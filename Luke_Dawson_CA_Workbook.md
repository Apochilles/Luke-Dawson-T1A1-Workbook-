## 1: Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must describe at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time.

The seeds of the internet were sown in the late 1950's with the launching of Sputnik One. America's leaders acted swiftly and decisively deciding they would need a way to collect and access all available technological information at any time. In 1958 APRA (The Advanced Research Projects Agency) was founded and In 1969, four university computers in America had been linked, allowing for primitive national communication and sharing of information. APRA then developed packets as an efficient way to send data to other computers in their small network. With the 1970’s came more breakthroughs with the development of TCP and IP allowing their single Network to become a Network of Networks.   
 
Despite these major advancements the internet was still very much an academic, government and military technology. It wasn’t until the 1990’s that steps were made to make the internet public and it became a household name 
 
When Tim Berners-Lee joined Cern in 1979 he wrote a program to understand who did what at Cern. His Program worked by picking up on keywords and cross referencing them. It was called Enquire and worked like an encyclopedia. It was the ideas from this program that launched his major breakthrough, The World Wide Web 
 
The World Wide Web's goal was to allow Cern staff to share information with each other from all around the world. WWW had two principals. HTML or HyperText Markup Language and URL or Universal Resource Locator.
 
HTML is a universal computer language that we use to access the internet while URL is a reference to a website. He used these technologies to launch the first public Website on August 6, 1991. Fortunately, Berner-Lee insisted he did not want to patent this technology allowing for rapid adoption and development of these technologies.
 
Now public facing websites were a possibility, the first blog appeared in early 1994. Written by Justin Hall, a student at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania 'Justin’s Links From The Underground' was a personal journal focussed on sharing his life with other students, friends and his family.Though this seems a very common practice on the internet today, this was an extremely novel concept at the time and by 2005 a study was released saying that 32 million Americans read internet blogs. 
 
By the mid nineties, even though websites had become somewhat popularised and were being used creatively, we he had no way of indexing all these sites popping up. The internet needed Search engines.
 
The concept of the search engine had been around for some time but had limited scope and were mainly used in universities for research purposes.
 
In 1998 Google Search was launched and used algorithms to do more specific indexing allowing for better search results and became the template for search engines going forward. 
 
In May 1997 the First social media platform, Six Degrees launched. While it was a dinosaur it still included many of the features we take for granted today such as profiles, friends lists, and school affiliations. Unfortunately the internet was far too novel at the time and only 2% of the world was online. It was only in 2002 with the development of Friendster followed by the massive Myspace and Facebook that social media really blew up. 
 
Some would say that internet video is now the biggest thing of internet. Prior to this we only had access to TV, video and DVD so the when Youtube arrived in 2005 and offered of video on demand, 24/7 it skyrocketed to success and continues to be the most popular form of video content today.  
 
 
 ## 2: Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:    
 ### Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.
    
Word count guide: 50 - 100 words per dot point
      
 ### Packets:     
 
  Packets are essential to the development of the internet due to the sheer volume of information traffic at any one time. It would be illogical for every single message to be sent in one piece as it would be huge and would take a long time to arrive at its destination. Therefore, when we send something over the internet it does not follow a fixed path. It goes from computer to computer in something called a packet. A packet contains many different bits from many different transmissions on the internet. These packets have both the IP address of the sender and the IP address of the receiver. The packets pass through something called a router that directs the package and makes sure it goes to the right destination.

 ### IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6):

When the internet was convcieved it was on a local network but as the network grew and many devices in the world needed to connect to the internet, it is necessary to assign Internet Protocol or IP addresses as unique identifiers to these devices. 

IPv4, the first version of IP, is made up of 32 binary bits. It is expressed by four base-10 numbers separated by dots. It is the more commonly used of the two.

IPv6 is the newest IP address standard. It is made up of 128 binary bits and is expressed by eight groups of base-16 (hexadecimal) digits separated by colons. 

IP is how the devices identify themselves and others. IP allows the amount of computers in the world to  exponetionally grow, while still being able to maintain unique identities.  

 ### Routers and routing:

When a packet travels from the computer it is sent from it will arrive at a router. The Router is a smart device that will read the IP address of the packet and make sure it's heading to the right destination in the most efficient way. It is able to identify congestion it will re route the traffic to ensure the information travels in a timely fashion 

If it wasn't for routers packets would not travel efficiently to their destination  
    
 ### Domains and DNS:

 DNS or Domain systems takes the user friendly domain name eg: https://coderacademy.edu.au and converts it back to IP addresses so browser can load internet webpages.

 Without DNS making the web more user friendly we would either have to remember long IP names as addresses to webpages or we wouldn't be able to access the webpages we use everyday. 

  ## 3: Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
        
TCP, HTTP and HTTPS (word count guide: 150 - 300 words) 

TCP or Transmission Control Protocol works with your IP and determines how computers exchange packets between each other.

It is in charge of breaking up data into packets that the network can deliver and manages control flow. It also retransmits lost packets and puts them back on the right path.  

Without TCP, packaging and maintaining quality control of information over the internet, we would either recieve misdirected or incomplete data.

HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol is used to transfer hypertext. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the web.  

It is the protocol used for viewing webpages. If you browse to "www.google.com" you send a HTTP request to the server. This is represented by the ```` http:\\ ```` at the start of the web address. Without HTTP we wouldn't be able to access public webpages and the internet wouldn't have been able to develop. 

But what if you are inputting or accessing sensitive information? It will all be sent as unprotected text so it leave you open to attacks from hackers.

This is where HTTPS or Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol comes in. HTTPS encrypts the data being transfered over the internet is secure. 

This development allowed for private messaging or high risk activities like banking or using credit cards online.

Web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools) (200 - 300 words)

Web Browsers are software that search for and display webpages. 

They translate websites returned by HTTP into inteperable content. They also display HTTPS and FPS (File Tranfer Protocol)

Through the browser the user requests data and a TCP connection is established. After this the server responds to the request with the webpage and closes the TCP connection. 

When you load up a webpage, the browser converts the HTML and CSS with a feature called the browser rendering engine. This takes the raw HTML and CSS code and translates it into formatted text and images on the browser screen.    

Modern browsers now have developed features such as external plugins and developer tools. External plugins give extra functionality to your browser while development tools allow us to inspect the HTML and CSS embedded in our webpages. With this we can live edit the visuals and text displayed in the browser. They also have tools that allow debugging and a feature that allows users to see how their websites will display on multiple devices. 

This is important to web developers so they can see how their webpages are rendered and how


## Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet (50 - 150 words for each technology)

   TCP:
     When a client requests a web page they are asking the server to provide a service. 
     
     The clients IP connects with TCP of the server which determine how the many packets the information will be in and sends the packet on it's way.
     
    Once it's arrival has been confirmed by TCP it shuts down. The reason it does this is because it is stateless. This means that every new request, even if you close your webpage and reload it is a new request.  

    The purpose of this to free up networks for continuous use allowing constant two way client\server interaction the internet    

   HTTP: 
   Once the client has connected with the TCP the client sends a HTTP GET request to the server asking for the website to be displayed in the browser. HTTP is the language our browser uses to talk to the server and is neccesary for clients and servers to communicate on the internet.

   Without a universal language we as the client would have no way of requesting information from the server and the internet wouldn't be able to function.  

   HTTPS:
  If the server contains sensitive information and the client sends a GET request to the server the server will respond with it's certificate. The browser then checks if the certificate is valid. 

  If the security conditions are met the user is able to display the website, otherwise they are warned by the browser. 

  Without this service there would be no way the server would be able to identify if you were a legitimate or ilegimate client and we wouldn't have any privacy of the internet. 

Web Browsers:
  Web Browsers allow internet users to connects to servers as a client. Without a browser a user connected to internet would have no way of requesting information from a server on the internet. Even if we could request these webpages without a browser we wouldn't be able to render the HTML and CSS that we recieved from the GET request and the information recieved would be indespharble to a human. 
 
  ## 4: Identify THREE data structures used in the Ruby programming language and explain the reasons for using each.
   
   Word count guide: 50 - 100 words on each data structure

Ruby uses Data Structures to file and reference data.

Arrays are an ordered integer-index that can contain different data types. Information in an array can be indexed starting at 0 and ending at -1. 

Arrays allow you to store multiple values into a variable which are easily accesible with methods. Using these we can easily add, subtract from our ordered list of information.  

For example if I wanted to assign a sex, age and status to a student name I could use an array to store the information in the name variable to be retrieved later. 


Hashes are a more developed data structure. They index data into a key and value stucture. 

Using this you can index a hash with other datatypes, not just intergers. This is most useful when we need our data to be specifically labelled. 

For example, if we wanted to catalog a classroom of 28 student names we would use a hash as we could assign Classroom key to student name values.


Sets are another Ruby class that stores data like an array. Unlike an array though you cannot use an index to access an element. There is also no duplicates allowed in a set.  

Sets however make it very easy to identify unique entries in a list and quickly retrieve them.


 
 ## 5   Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.

Word count guide: 100 - 200 words on each way code is executed.

Interpreters:
When programming was conceived it was originally very low level. This meant the machine code inputted and outputted was nearly indecipherable to a human reader. As time went on and we developed more comprehensive programming languages we were able to communicate clearly with a computer while maintaining a high level of human understanding. This is known as high level programming. 
 
Interpretive languages like Python and Ruby do this translation line by line as the program runs. While this means it’s easier to use, it procedurally analyses the code until it breaks making debugging easy and is more memory efficient it is also slower as interprets each line of code in real-time.   
 
 
Compilers:
 
Languages like C++ and Basic instead compile their code. When the programmer is ready to execute their code in these languages they must first run a code to generate a .exe file. This overall takes more time than interpreting but only has to translate once. When this .exe is run the code is already interpreted into machine code making it’s execution faster. It however generates intermediate machine code making it more more memory dependant. It also needs to be specifically compiled for OS X, Windows or Linux, as well as 32bit 64bit architectures.     

 

 ## 6:   Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.

Word count guide: 200 - 400 words on each language

### Ruby on Rails:

Ruby is a high level and object-oriented programming language developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto in 1995.
 
High level programming's goal is to bring programming languages closer to our human languages. It has less abstraction and is easier to read and write. 
 
Matz as he's more commonly known has a clear objective with Ruby. he wanted to make Ruby "natural, not just simple.”[^1]
 
He also generously released it as open source, meaning it can be modified or enhanced by anyone. This is how Ruby on Rails came about. 
 
In 2004, Ruby on Rails, a rapid web development framework was released as open source software. 
 
As it was developed in Ruby it inherits many strengths of it’s Ruby origins. It has an extensive library of free third party modules (gems) and it is next generation which means it’s constantly getting support from new developers.
 
Ruby on Rails sky rocketed into success as a web development tool and continues to have massive success to this day. Famous for its speed and ease of use leading to massive productivity. Websites such as Github, Airbnb and Etsy are all on Ruby on Rails 
 
It also has a feverish fan base, the excitement at Ruby on Rails Oceania meetups in Melbourne is palpable, brimming with enthusiastic developers of all ages and experience levels looking to discuss their personal experiences with Ruby on Rails.
 
Ruby on Rails has three basic principles:
 
Convention over configuration, meaning that the developer only has to specify non conventional aspects of the applications allowing for less code to be written to have a working program.
 
Metaprogramming, which is a method that allows the user to write programs using programs making building applications easier and faster
 
And Automated testing, which means that Ruby on Rail has built in automatic testing making test cases easier to write and execute. 
 
Ruby on Rails does of course does have some drawbacks. 
 
Ruby on Rails is considered to have a slow runtime compared with more modern competitors such as NodeJS and GoLang. It also has a slow boot speed depending on the amount of gem dependencies and files.


#### Basic:

Basic or Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code is know as the computer language of the 1980's. 
Basic is a general-purpose, high-level programming language and has it's origins in 1960's and was developed by Dartmouth mathematicians as a teaching tool for undergraduates. 

Basic took on a new life in 1975 when Microsoft wrote a version of basic for The Altair personal computer. Later this version was adopted by Apple and IBM's DOS. 

The craze at the time was books with instructions to program simple games and programs from scratch. Basic begins every line of code with a line number beginning at 10 and moving up in 10's from there. These computers didn't have word processors or text editors so it was hard to go back and edit lines so you had to be very careful with your input.   

Basics inherit simplicity was one of it's greatest strengths. Following along with a book you could have a working version of hangman running on your home PC within an hour with no previous experience with the language. 

Unfortunately this was also it's most major limitation. 










## 7: Identify TWO ethical issues from the areas below and discuss the extent to which an IT professional is ethically responsible in terms of the issue.

Word count guide: 200 - 400 words for each ethical issue

      
 criminal acts such as theft, fraud, trafficking and distribution of prohibited substances, terrorism:

aggressive sales and marketing practices designed to mislead and deceive consumers:
        

### For each ethical issue identify a source of legal information relating to the ethical issue and discuss whether the law is helpful in assisting a developer to act in an ethical way.

   criminal acts such as theft, fraud, trafficking and distribution of prohibited substances, terrorism:

   aggressive sales and marketing practices designed to mislead and deceive consumers:

   Word count guide: 200 words max

    Conduct research into a case study of ONE of the ethical issues you have chosen discuss how an ethical IT professional should respond to the case study and how they might mitigate or prevent ethical breaches.

   Word count guide: 400 - 600 words

   ## 8: Explain control flow, using an example from the Ruby programming language (100 words)

When we program, we write a set of instructions in a language a computer can understand. 

Control Flow is order in which we tell the computer to read and perform these instructions. 

``` 
def truth_test(boolean)
  if boolean == true
    puts "TRUE!"
  else boolean == false 
    puts "False...."
  end
 end

truth_test(false)
```
As in my example above, control flow is always represented as an if (or a while) and an else. When writing control flow we must always write in a way that can be presented as a boolean.  

I use Operators to determine whether or not what i'm asking the computer is true or false.

When I call my function the  ``` == ``` tells my computer that if the parameter boolean is true, it will print to the screen ``` TRUE! ``` Otherwise the ``` == ``` tells my computer if the parameter boolean is false, it will print to the screen ````  False.... ````


   ## 9: Explain type coercion (100 words)

   Type coercion in programming is changing one data type to another. 
   
   Common examples of data types include integers, booleans and string.

   Often we are required to transform these data types so that the language 
   can interpret what we are asking of it.  




   ## 10: Explain data types, using examples (100 words)

When programming, there is only a set number of information types that your computer can interact with. When inputting information into a program we must conform to these types so the computer knows what functions it can perform of the information. 

As Ruby is an Object orientated language, these data types are based on classes.  

``` 
students = ['Grace', 'Manna', 'Sean', 'Annie']
scores = [63, 86, 77, 91]
grade_point_average = [3.5, 2.8, 4.0, 3.7]
 
```
 
In this code written in Ruby, I have included four examples of data types in Ruby: Arrays, Strings, Floats and Integers. 
 
I have wrapped my Strings, Integers and floats with ``` [] ``` which creates an array around them. 
 
By putting quotations around the names of my students in my students array I have stored the characters that make up their names into a string. 
 
My floats in the grade_point_average array are separated by a decimal ``` . ``` differentiating them from my whole number integers. 



   ## 11: Here’s the problem: “There is a restaurant serving a variety of food. The customers want to be able to buy food of their choice. All the staff just quit, how can you build an app to replace them?”

   Identify the classes you would use to solve the problem:



   Write a short explanation of why you would use the classes you have identified

  ## 12:  Identify and explain the error in the code that is preventing correct execution of the program (100 words)
```
celsius = gets.to_i
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
print "The result is: "
print fahrenheit
puts "."
```

Celcius needs to be inputted as an integer. When we use ``` gets ``` the ruby code expects us to input a string. Even if we provide it with an integer, the ```gets``` method will convert the integer into string 0 which will error the program.

By utilising the ruby method ``` get.to_i ``` we are converting our input into a integer therefore giving the program something that it can utilize.


 ## 13:   The following code looks for the first two elements that are out of order and swaps them; however, it is not producing the correct results. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly.

```
arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
i = 0
i += 1 while (i < arr.size - 1) && (arr[i] < arr[i + 1])

arr[i], arr[i + 1] = arr[i + 1], arr[i]

puts arr
```

 ## 14:   Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:
   Create a flowchart to outline the steps for listing all prime numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Your flowchart should make use of standard conventions for flowcharts to indicate processes, tasks, actions, or operations

https://drive.google.com/file/d/19oi9fl2jpMODV0I79_BEjsIjs44c3oUR/view?usp=sharing

   Write pseudocode for the process outlined in your flowchart:
  
   ``` 
   This program will allow the user to find all the prime numbers inclusive of zero between a range of their choosing.

   - Enter your range of numbers. Push zero into the start of your array.
   - Is each of your numbers in the range you have inputted divisible by two while returning a whole number?
   - Push whole number into prime_number array
   - Is a number in your range not divisible by two while returning a whole number?
   - Skip number and continue on to the next unevaluted number in the range.
   - Are there no more numbers to be evaluated?
   - Print prime_number array to the screen 
   ```
  

 ## 15:   Write pseudocode OR Ruby code for the following problem:

You have access to two variables: raining (boolean) and temperature (integer). If it’s raining and the temperature is less than 15 degrees, print to the screen “It’s wet and cold”, if it is less than 15 but not raining print “It’s not raining but cold”. If it’s greater than or equal to 15 but not raining print “It’s warm but not raining”, and otherwise tell them “It’s warm and raining”.

```
def weather_conditions(temperature, raining)
  if temperature < 15 && raining == true

    puts 'It’s wet and cold'

  elsif temperature < 15 && raining == false
    puts 'It’s not raining but cold'

  elsif temperature >= 15 && raining == false
    puts 'It’s warm but not raining'

  else temperature >= 15 && raining == true
       puts 'It’s warm and raining'

  end
end

puts weather_conditions(14, true)
puts weather_conditions(14, false)
puts weather_conditions(15, false)
puts weather_conditions(15, true)

```


 ## 16:   An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for). The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:
       
eggs (1)
peanuts (2)
shellfish (4)
strawberries (8)
tomatoes (16)
chocolate (32)
pollen (64)
cats (128)

So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.

Write a program that, given a person’s score can tell them: a) whether or not they’re allergic to a given item b) the full list of allergies.

```
def allergy_search(number)
  allergens = {"cats" => 128, "pollen" => 64, "chocolate" => 32, "tomatoes" => 16, 
                "strawberries" => 8, "shellfish" => 4, "peanuts" => 2, "eggs" => 1}
  has_allergies = []
  allergens.each do |allergy, points|
    if number % points != number
      has_allergies.push(allergy, points)
      number = number % points
    end
  end
 has_allergies
end

a) puts allergy_search(#if you put your score in here it will add up which allergies you have and print the score and allergy#) 
b) puts allergy_search(255 #this will print the full list of allergies#)
```
