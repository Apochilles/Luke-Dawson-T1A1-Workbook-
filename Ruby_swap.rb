  ##  Identify and explain the error in the code that is preventing correct execution of the program (100 words)

#  celsius = gets
#     fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
#     print "The result is: "
#     print fahrenheit
#     puts "."

  # celsius = gets.to_i
  #   fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
  #   print "The result is: "
  #   print fahrenheit
  #   puts "."

 ##   The following code looks for the first two elements that are out of order and swaps them; however, it is not producing the correct results. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly.

arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
i = 0
while (i < arr.size - 1 and arr[i] < arr[i + 1])
  i = i + 1 end
puts i
    arr[i] = arr[i + 1]
    arr[i + 1] = arr[i]


   # while 0 is less then 9 - 1 = 8
   #
